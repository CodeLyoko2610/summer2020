# Summer 2020 Internships - Engineering Assignment

_This is a mandatory homework task for Wolt's engineering intern positions. Read more about our summer jobs in 2020 [here](https://www.wolt.com)._

_Every intern who we hired last year continued with us as a software engineer after the summer. Good luck with the assignment and hopefully we will see you in our team soon!_

## In short

1. Select either frontend or backend version of this assignment. **No need to do both of them**.
2. Solve the task. When you are ready, leave us an application [here](https://www.wolt.com) accompanied by your solution (stored in a GitHub repository or if in other format, send your code to severi.kausola@wolt.com)
3. That's it! We will get back to you.

## Overview

A list of restaurants is an important element in Wolt app. Depending on where our customers are located, they will be able to order food from few dozen or even from hundreds of different restaurants. Views in the app (_Discovery, Search, Delivers, Nearby_) sort restaurants based on the delivery time, popularity, rating and various other factors when trying to find the most relevant matches for each customer.  

Your task is to either display a list of restaurant using the given data set ([Option 1](#option1)) **OR** create an API that allows searching restaurants from the data set ([Option 2](#option2)).

Fun fact: the data set contains real Wolt restaurants, so we actually use a very similar json-format internally.

## Restaurant data

_restaurant.json_ contains fifty restaurants from central Helsinki area. Each object has a set fields providing more information about the restaurant, like _name_, _image_ and _location_. 

Example:

    {
        "city": "Helsinki",
        "currency": "EUR",
        "delivery_price": 390,
        "description": "Japanilaista ramenia parhaimmillaan",
        "image": "https://prod-wolt-venue-images-cdn.wolt.com/5d108aa82e757db3f4946ca9/d88ebd36611a5e56bfc6a60264fe3f81",
        "location": [
            24.941786527633663,
            60.169934599421396
        ],
        "name": "Momotoko Citycenter",
        "online": false,
        "tags": [
            "ramen",
            "risotto"
        ],
        "blurhash": "j2DUFG8jbu8AXuLIT5Tt0B01R2;;",
    }

Fields: 

- _city_ : A city where the restaurant is located (type: _string_)
- _currency_: ISO 4217 code of the currency the restaurant is using (type: _string_)
- _delivery price_: Delivery cost from the restaurant to a customer. The price is stored as subunits, so 390 in this case would be 3.90â‚¬ (type: _integer_)
- _description_: More information about what kind of restaurant it is (type: _string_)
- _image_: A link to restaurant's image (type: _string_)
- _location_: Restaurant's location in latitude & longitude coordinates. First element in the list is the longitude (type: a list containing two decimal elements)
- _name_: The name of the restaurant (type: _string_)
- _online_: If _true_, the restaurant is accepting orders at the moment. If _false_, then ordering is not possible (type: _boolean_)
- _tags_: A list of tags describing what kind of food the restaurant sells, e.g. pizza / burger (type: a list of strings, max.  3 elements)
- _blurhash_ : See [bonus task](#bonus)

## Option 1) Frontend task - displaying a list of restaurants with sort functionality

Build a web page that shows all fifty restaurants. You can freely decide which fields to utilize from restaurants objects, so no need to put all the data visible. However, please use **at least three** fields.

There are no restrictions on design, so restaurants can be displayed vertically, horizontally, on a grid or however you decide. Aim for clear and responsive design.

In addition of rendering restaurants, create a possibility to sort restaurants alphabetically in ascending / descending order, e.g. by adding a _sort_-button on the top of the list.

An example what the end result could look like:

<a name="option2"></a>
## Option 2) Backend task - search
Create an API endpoint that allows searching restaurants. API needs to accept three parameters:
- _q_: query string. Full or partial match for the string is searched from _name_, _description_ and _tags_ fields. A minimum length for the query string is one character.
- _lat_: latitude coordinate (customer's location)
- _lon_ : longitude coordinate (customer's location)

API will return restaurant (objects) which **match the given query string** and are **closer than 3 kilometers** from coordinates. 

Example query:

    /restaurants/search?q=sushi&lat=60.17045&lon=24.93147
    
This search would return restaurants which contain a word _sushi_ and are closer than 3km to the location [60.17045, 24.93147].
    
Please **do not** use any on-disk database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, ...) or ElasticSearch in this assignment. The task can be completed without them.
    
### Bonus task: Blurhash
<a name="bonus"></a>
Restaurant data also includes a field called _blurhash_. As a bonus task you can figure out what this field is and use it: 
- In frontend task you can render the blurhash data
- In backend task you can e.g. validate that _blurhash_-field is correct when loading data from _restaurant.json_

There are some ready-made libraries for manipulating _blurhash_ values. Feel free to also create your own one.

Bonus task is completely optional and it doesn't affect how we review assignments. It exists only for fun! ðŸ˜€
    
## Instructions
- Write the assignment using either TypeScript / JavaScript, Python, Scala, Kotlin or Java
- Feel free to use any 3rd party framework / library, however try to minimize external dependencies
- Write clear instructions how to get the project up and running

## Few tips
- Everyone in Wolt loves clean code
- Everyone in Wolt also loves good unit test coverage
- Try to figure out what is the essential part in this task. Focus on that first.
- Don't forget README.md
